The browser is closed within the same context it was created in, and we have proper error handling for all operations. Try running the script again - the event loop issue should be resolved. If you're still having issues with the editor not being found, we may need to try different selectors or approaches to interact with the Scribbr site. This approach skips the problematic paste-upload container completely and tries to interact directly with the editor. Run this script and check the screenshots folder to see what's being displayed at each step. This should help identify exactly what's happening on the page.
